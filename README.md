## These are some of my personal projects

- [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://gabodotcodes.github.io/apod/src): It's a vanilla javascript website that shows a highlight image of NASA. 👨‍🚀🚀 First of all I drew a wireframe in my board and then I put it on Figma, to finally code and practice fetch and css media queries.

- [Colombia Holidays](https://gabodotcodes.github.io/colombian-holidays-front-practice/): There are 2 project that make work this, an API with NodeJs to check Colombian holidays in a month, in a year and check if a day is holiday and a UI to be user friendly. 🏖️✈️ I readed the law that define holidays in Colombia to make this project and I found an anonymous algorythm to calculate Easter Day.
